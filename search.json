My name is Iraitz Montalbán and I love to mess around with technology.\nActually I am using this blog to explore new-ish technology and explain things so other can benefit from it and meanwhile, I can get a better understanding on it. So, sometimes I will be talking about Python or Julia and the controversy around which one is best, will be exploring really basic stuff so I can refresh my memory, maybe review a paper or simply just play around with a new tool.\nI will just let my curiosity drive this thing wherever it takes me. Happy that you want to join me."
