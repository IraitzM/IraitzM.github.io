I have been developing documentation sites with the usual suspects for a while:\nSometimes hosted on ReadTheDocs which makes it really easy to deploy, in other cases hosted in Github Pages. During the last month I have been exploring Quarto which was one my tech to review list for a while. Really cool project indeed. In fact, this blog is all done using it."

    "text": "Markdown, first level citizen\nIt is challenging to build sites when you come from the data domain. No idea about CSS or Javascript but you want your site to look cool and engaging. Well, Quarto does this using pure Markdown like many others. It has its own extension .qmd but it also allows for Jupyter Notebooks or pure MD files to be rendered. This is often a challenge in other frameworks as you need to install extensions to do that (ex Markdown on Sphinx).\nQuarto supports those formats by default."

It uses Rust under the hood which makes it really performant. They also had rye package manager for a while but its successor, uv, has become the defacto project management tool even though there are some thinks I don’t fully like.\nThe mean feature is… well, it is the Usain Bolt of the package installers. Soooo fast. Solves the dependency tree blazing fast and keeps the local environment up to date.\nTwo things that make me still prefer PDM over uv is the project initialization. PDM creates a basic folder structure that works for me\nproject\n| - src/\n| - test/\n| - pyproject.toml\nwhile uv creates a hello.py file that I have to delete all the time.\nProbably the most annoying thing about uv is when you need to add all extras to you local development environment. You need to run\nuv sync --all-extras --dev\nit is a minor thing, but you need to remember it.\nMore on this? There is a beautiful entry by Anna-Lena Popkes on her blog definitely worth checking."
