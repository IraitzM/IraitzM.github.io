    "section": "Measurement",
    "text": "Measurement\nMeasuring quantum states is a necessary condition to extract information out of it, but by doing so we affect the system due to the collapse of the wave function. Observables (self-adjoin operators) are used to project the measurement of a given quantum state to one of its eigenvalues by using the closeness between quantum state and eigenvectors of the observable being used. The eigenvectors of the observable form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space, therefore each measure corresponds to a mapping to the eigenvectors comprising the basis.\nWe will see that a common observable used is the Pauli \\(\\sigma_z\\) matrix\n\\[\n\\sigma_z = \\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\]\nwhose decomposition is\n\\[\n\\sigma_z|0\\rangle = 1|0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\sigma_z|1\\rangle = -1|1\\rangle\n\\]\ntherefore, any potential measurement will be mapped to one of those two eigenvectors and its eigenvalue used as the outcome of the measurement. The basis set shown above is often known as the computational basis and it will become relevant when we move to actual implementations.\nFrom our previous state \\(|\\phi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle\\) and perform a measurement over the computational basis (\\(|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle\\)) where evidently the outcome would be \\(|0\\rangle\\) with \\(|\\alpha|^2\\) probability or \\(|1\\rangle\\) with \\(|\\beta|^2\\) probability. But more importantly, a single measurement, no matter how complex, entangled or superposed our state might be, will only be able to recover classical bits mapping two previously seen states (\\(|0\\rangle \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(|1\\rangle \\rightarrow 1\\)).\nWhat happens after measurement is performed? Well, that is the trickiest part as the process of measuring obliges to our quantum state to position itself and make a choice. This means our quantum state after measurement will no longer be in a superposition state and will be the outcome of the previous measurement \\(|0\\rangle\\) for the remaining time period.\nIn order to fully grasp the statistics of the state we should find way to reproduce the state and perform enough measurements, so we can characterize its actual condition as much as we can out of the measurement statistics it presents. Measuring in the basis \\(\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}\\) (also called computational basis) may not be enough to capture the actual state. Therefore, a basis change is needed, but we will see that quantum devices only offer computational basis as the measuring basis. That means in certain cases we will need to rotate our qubits so that the basis change is artificially done.\nIf we would like to measure in the \\(\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}\\) basis then a rotation of \\(-\\pi / 2\\) in the Y axis will be needed. \\(\\{|i\\rangle, |-i\\rangle\\}\\) basis will require then a rotation over X axis of \\(\\pi / 2\\). That way we get to shift the reference point and measure according to our target axis."

    "section": "Superposition",
    "text": "Superposition\nThis is one of the trickiest things to get when first approaching quantum computing as it is not so intuitive from our macroscopic perspective. It is also often misunderstood, we will try to make it clear. This is an example of a superposed state\n\\[\n|\\phi\\rangle =\n\\alpha |0\\rangle +\n\\beta |1\\rangle.\n\\]\nThe state is a superposed state, no questions on that, but our ability to perceive it is limited by the measurement procedure itself. We need to project our quantum state into one of the two potential states we can detect (\\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\)). Sadly, when measuring only classical bits can be obtained (0 or 1) so no probability amplitude, no phase… information gets lost in the measurement process.\nThe probability histogram is created after a sequence of quantum state creations and measurements we often call SHOTS.\n\n\n\n\nCoin toss\n\n\n\nFor a series of measurements we have seen \\(|0\\rangle\\) state 50.6% and \\(|1\\rangle\\) state 49.4%. Definitely, looks superposed to me. It is hardly perceived in the classical regime were every basis state will be interpreted as its complementary classical bit, but quantum state holds a lot of information more than this simple binary choice.\nIn fact, both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are complex numbers, that is why bloch sphere renders a more in detail expression of the state of a qubit. Sadly for us this is something we will never perceive from a real device but helps while building the formalism or creating algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nBloch sphere\n\n\n\nQuantum states can therefore be expressed also as:\n\\[\n|\\phi\\rangle = \\cos (\\theta/2) |0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi} \\sin (\\theta/2)|1\\rangle\n\\]\nwhich represents the sphere coordinates on the surface of the bloch sphere. It is more evident in this case that rendering simple bits will actually remove most of the information contained in the states when operating with them in the quantum regime.\nI think is enough for today but keep an eye, I will continue some of this explanations."

My name is Iraitz Montalban and I love to mess around with technology.\nActually I am using this blog to explore new-ish technology and explain things so other can benefit from it and meanwhile, I can get a better understanding on it. So, sometimes I will be talking about Python or Julia and the controversy around which one is best, will be exploring really basic stuff so I can refresh my memory, maybe review a paper or simply just play around with a new tool.\nI will just let my curiosity drive this thing wherever it takes me. Happy that you want to join me."
