Hi! My name is Iraitz Montalb√°n and I love to mess around with technology.

Actually I am using this blog to explore new-_ish_ technology and explain things so other can benefit from it and meanwhile, I can get a better understanding on it. So, sometimes I will be talking about Python or Julia and the controversy around which one is best, will be exploring really basic stuff so I can refresh my memory, maybe review a paper or simply just play around with a new tool.

I will just let my curiosity drive this thing wherever it takes me. Happy that you want to join me.
